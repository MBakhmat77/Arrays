How many students have a grade above average?

function aboveAverageScore (arr) {
let sum = 0;
let count = 0;
  let average = 0;
for (let i = 0; i <arr.length; i ++) {
sum = sum + arr [i];
average = sum / arr.length;
  if (arr [i]> sum / arr.length)
 count = count + i; 
}
return count;
}
console.log (aboveAverageScore ([2,4,5,2,2,3,3,2,3,2,2,4,5,4]));
